```python
I have imported four modules for the first question : os,glob,codecs,email.parser,csv
Have given a relative path so that you could put your absolute path based on where your folders are residing
    relative_path='/Users/Sneha/Downloads/maildir' 

Here i am using a definition: def check_file_or_dir to check if its a file or folder 
    If its a folder we will loop through to check if we encouter a folder again if not then its a file,
    then the file is read
after the file is read, three analysis are performed
Analysis
1.) To find the number of mails which has been sent and recieved during the month of Dec 2001
For this i globally declared count_mails so that total mails in that particular month can be counted.
Using email parser we can parse through the emails and using header.parser we can find the head as Date and get the required output based on it
2.)
